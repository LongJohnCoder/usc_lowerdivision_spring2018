Biskit's Derivative Day

This is Biskit:

He is a very lazy dog enrolled in some Calculus one classes and learned the power rule. His teacher decided that Biskit needed some homework problems to get a grasp on the material. She gave him a set of problems with polynomials of different degrees. All the exponents and coefficents are positive numbers.

Bisket as you know is very lazy. So he wants you to do his homework for him! You love Bisket and will do anything for him to not move out of your town so you agree. But you are also very lazy, and don't want to do all of it by hand so you write a program!

Write a program that takes the derivate of each polynomial in a list of polynomials.
